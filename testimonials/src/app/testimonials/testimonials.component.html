      <p>ProGrad is not like other online programming courses. It is entirely a self-learning journey. You can learn by
        doing. The practise sessions given in this program was very useful. My mentor motivated me and helped me to
        crack the aptitude round
        of Mphasis.</p>

      <p>Even if you're not strong with coding basics or programming concepts, this program is designed in such a way
        that you can enhance your skills. On top of that, it provides you with good placement opportunities. The program
        also helps improve
        your communication skills. I recommend this program to all my juniors.
